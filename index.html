							<p>Hi!! I don't know how you end up on my website, maybe you are a friend, family or a recruiter, maybe I just applied
								for
								a job at your company and now you want to see if i am a good fit for your company, if that's the case great!!!
								I was born in Cape Verde an Archipelago on the west coast of Africa but live in the United States since 2009, I can
								write and speak in English, Portuguese, Spanish and Capeverdean Kriol.
								My first job when I first got here was computer repair mostly dealing with hardware issues
								after it became cheap to buy a new computer instead of fixing them business was slow so I had to break into a
								different
								field at the time I needed a job quick I started working as a truck driver and for many years that's all I did but I'm
								not sure if I would do a good job trying to explain what it feels like to wake up every day and go do a job that
								doesn't
								fulfill you.
								Ok so after working as a truck driver for many years I always wanted to get into Tech but never knew how until I
								someone
								I follow on twitter told me about Lambda School and now here we are :)
								In this page, you can look into most of the projects I was able to build while in Lambda and many of the main projects
								in my page was build with the collaboration of a few other students when we collaborate for what we call Build Week
								when
								a group of 2 a 10 students from Data Science, IOS, Android and UX Designer work on a specific project, please Look
								Around!!
